//! The simplest to use transport a `gready_stream`
//!
//! The transport agressively reads everything from input socket putting it
//! into the buffer. Similarly everything put into output buffer is just sent
//! back to the user.
//!
//! It's assumed that Protocol is able to keep up with the input rate. But if
//! it's not always the case you can always see input buffer size and drop
//! a connection. Currently you can't throttle neither reading end nor writer
//! (i.e. don't put everything to the output buffer at once)
//!
//! This is tradeoff to have super simple protocol and semantics. More
//! elaborate protocols will be implemented in the future.
